/* Plan



Priorities
0. Don't get hit by an incoming bullet
1. Record possible mine positions, never go on these suspected coordinates
2. If under 40% hp find three cells where your sure no mines were placed and dodge bullets from there
2. Line up with other players from a distance and fire
3. Lay mines if bored
4. If alone shoot the walls like a maniac
