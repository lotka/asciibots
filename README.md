asciibots
=========

A few ascii characters convene in a dark cave to fight till the last man.

Written in C, the idea is that little bots try to fight each other in a small 2d world. A bot is just a function, at the moment these are very basic but the plan is to give them enough mental power to be able to produce an interesting battle.

The bots can only do one operation each turn, for example:
* Move (by one unit up, left, down or right)
* Fire bullet (up, left, down or right)
* Lay mine (not yet implemented)
