asciibots
=========

A few ascii characters convene in a dark cave to fight till the last man.

Written completely in C, the idea is that little bots try to fight each other. Each turn they are allowed to do one only one operation, examples are movement, fire bullet or lay mine.

Each bot has its own function which is written by each player, this works by giving your bots object (yes we have implemented objects in C because we are slightly insane) a pointer to that function. Then everything plays out on the screen.
